# React Starter Project

## Prerequisites
https://egghead.io/lessons/react-react-fundamentals-development-environment-setup#/tab-code
assumes you have installed babel, webpack, and webpack dev server

*protip for windows* 
- The command prompt sucks, download and use <a href="http://cmder.net/">cmder</a> instead
- cmder won't run as admin by default, which is needed to install Babel & Webpack globally
- Setup cmder to run as an administrator. Right click on the cmder title bar, settings for ConEmu, startup and change the {cmd} box to say {AdminPowerShell}
- If you ever have problems with npm on Windows.... make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest verion of Node on your machine. I've learned that the hard way.

####Babel
npm install -g babel-cli
####Webpack
npm install webpack -g
####Webpack Dev Server
npm install webpack-dev-server -g

## Run Project
- npm install
- npm start
- open up browser to localhost:3333
